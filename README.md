# React - ESLint and Prettier Boilerplate

First of all, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). There's nothing changed in the original created app. The thing here is just to use ESLint and Prettier.

## What's this about?

This is a simple (and precious) boilerplate for ESLint and Prettier setup for React development in VSCode.

## Content

The project simply has the `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` files, to make the VSCode work properly with some useful configuration.

## How to use

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Then follow the commands bellow.

### `yarn install`

Installs all the dependencies the project needs to run properly.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
